odd-item-finder
====
An algorithm to find an odd item from a random set of items.
Currrently the condition is that the dimension is greater then the rest.
The following assumtions are currently being made:
1) The set of objects is exactly 7
2) There is only one object with a increased dimension
3) All other objects have a common value for that dimension

Aside from writing the algorithm, I'm also trying apply devops principles:
1) Software testing
2) Generalization of functionality
3) Version controlled

The following are on the TODO:
- Apply to real world objects. eg files, servers, etc
- Take some form of input via command line or reading files
- Support variable set sizes
- Build script
- Dockerfile to package
